    <description>Fully asynchronous Redis client, capable of pipelined operations; this acts as a multiplexer, allowing high-performance parallel usage of a single connection (or few connections) without being blocked on each separate request. All core redis opeations are supported. This library can also be used from C# 5.0/async very effectively.</description>
    <summary>Efficient, fully asynchronous Redis client</summary>
    <releaseNotes>* 1.3.41  - Add: SCAN support (2.8+)
      * 1.3.40  - Add: slowlog support; save/bgsave/lastsave support
      * 1.3.39  - Add: ExtendLock / ReleaseLock (now has overload that checks value)
      * 1.3.38  - Add: DEBUG OBJECT... yess, I know this is not recommended for general usage
      * 1.3.37  - Fix: Client name not being sent on recent redis-server versions (due to "info" detection)
      * 1.3.36  - Fix: (critical) TakeLock not passing db correctly
      * 1.3.35  - Fix: bug when validating multiple exists/not-exists conditions in a transaction
      * 1.3.34  - Fix: raise shutdown/closure events in more scenarios
      * 1.3.33  - Fix: And... back to the newer async API (and fix error in keep-alive counter)
      * 1.3.32  - Add: show connection state and other info in counters
      * 1.3.31  - Fix: ensure transaction abort due to precondition-fail always cancels the unsent messages; use appropriate threads for their callbacks
      * 1.3.30  - Fix: use ConnectAsync rather than a task with sync Connect
      * 1.3.29  - Fix: better SocketError tracking with older async read API
      * 1.3.28  - Add: Make last command time available to the caller; use the older async read API
      * 1.3.27  - Add: GetCounters tracks the number of in-progress callbacks (sync and async)
      * 1.3.26  - Fix: Tidying up shutdown
      * 1.3.25  - Fix: Async-receive could misreport blame
      * 1.3.24  - Add: Much better tracking of who to blame for shutdown events; this is available on the connection and used in error messages
      * 1.3.23  - Add: Expose an explicit Shutdown event
      * 1.3.22  - Add: Make CompletionMode configurable (globally and per-connection)
      * 1.3.21  - Add: SuspendFlush/ResumeFlush
      * 1.3.20  - Add: support for DUMP/RESTORE
      * 1.3.19  - Add: support for batches; like transactions, but no guarantee of atomicity
      * 1.3.18  - Fix: close during "shutdown" was losing fault information
      * 1.3.17  - Fix: annoying null-ref is annoying
      * 1.3.16  - Fix: cleanup a few more unobserved exceptions
      * 1.3.15  - Fix: ensure all exceptions are "observed"
      * 1.3.14  - Fix: treat unsendable messages as cancelled
      * 1.3.13  - Fix: multi-channel subscribe was failing
      *         - Add: support for single-command locking w/ 2.6.12 or above
      * 1.3.12  - Fix: 1.3.11 was deploy fail :(
      * 1.3.11  - Fix: Environment.Ticks (from 1.3.7) simplified
      *           Add: Optionally inline callbacks when possible to reduce Task overhead
      * 1.3.10  - Fix: subscription connections may need to defer pending queue until after INFO, to
      *           ensure CLIENT SETNAME works; QUIT should not error during Dispose();
      * 1.3.9   - Add: "redis-command" to errors
      * 1.3.8   - Fix: possible null-ref during timeouts
      * 1.3.7   - Fix slow ConnectionUtils.Connect performance w/ 'down' servers
      *         - Avoid Environment.Ticks due to wrap-around
      * 1.3.6   - Adds TIME support
      *         - Pub/sub now returns Task to allow tracking of subscription
      *
      * 1.3.*- MAJOR CHANGES; 1.3 removes the threaded core to allow for more scalability over multiple connections;
      *           This is an API-breaking change (especially around pub/sub), and local validation is recommended
      *
      * 1.2.0.8 - Fix processing of info=&gt;redis_version to work with MS alpha redis
      * 1.2.0.7 - Client names now fully supported on 2.6.9+
      * 1.2.0.6 - Support client names on connections (in theory; API changes only)
      * 1.2.0.5 - Bug-fixes: large integer parsing
      * 1.2.0.4 - ConnectionUtils now supports sentinel
      * 1.2.0.3 - show current tie-breaker key in ConnectionUtils
      * 1.2.0.2 - added additional ConnectionUtils overloads to control master/slave behavior more granularly
      * 1.2.0.1 - adds SORT support (under Keys)
      * 1.2.0.0 - BREAKING CHANGE: SortedSets.{Rank|Score} now return nullable values
      *         - adds bindings for redis 2.6 commands
      *         - now strong-named
      *         - cumulative bug-fixes</releaseNotes>
